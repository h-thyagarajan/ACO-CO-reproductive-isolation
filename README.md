Abstract:
We ask if three decades and over 1 500 generations of divergent life history selection 
on age at reproduction has resulted in the evolution of reproductive isolation (RI) 
between laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We tested for premating, 
postmating-prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive isolation between 3 replicate 
population pairs. Large evolved differences in body size between selection treatments 
suggested the potential for prezygotic barriers driven by sexual selection or physical 
incompatibilities between the sexes. Although a simple prediction would be preference 
for larger size, creating directional isolation, our results from individual mate choice 
trials indicate that populations from both selection treatments show a marked bias towards 
homotypic mate choice; indicative of prezygotic RI driven by sexual selection or sexual 
conflict. Hybridization between the focal populations resulted in the production of viable 
adult flies with intermediate size and developmental traits. We observed a suggestive but 
statistically non-significant trend of fitness decline in the F2 generation of hybrids, 
but no significant evidence suggesting the evolution of postmating-prezygotic or postzygotic 
RI. Our findings are in accord with extant literature that posits that premating RI evolves 
before postmating forms of RI.
